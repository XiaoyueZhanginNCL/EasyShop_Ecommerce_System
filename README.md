# EasyShop_Ecommerce_System

## 1. Introduction
Developed a comprehensive e-commerce system independently, utilizing Vue2 for frontend development and Vuex for state management to ensure seamless data flow between components. Engineered a reliable backend server using Node.js and managed data storage with MySQL, employing Navicat for visual database administration. Implemented secure user access control through JWT, handling token generation and validation on the server-side and achieving token persistence via localStorage on the client-side for user authentication.
